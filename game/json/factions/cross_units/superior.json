    "Description": "A superior executor of the C.R.O.S.S. cult — humanoid, solemn, and cloaked in matte black armor etched with radiant green sigils. Its form walks with deliberate, priestlike motion, encased in flexible plates layered like ceremonial robes. Two vertical slits glow in place of eyes, and its body emits a soft harmonic drone like a liturgical chant translated into machine language. The armor appears almost grown rather than forged, with interlocking plates that shimmer subtly like obsidian under green starlight. Its face is obscured by a ritual mask—part circuitry, part totem—marked with shifting glyphs that crawl across the surface like luminous insects. Trailing cables mimic ceremonial vestments, and ambient mist curls around its feet as if repelled by its very presence. Additional plates form a flanged collar and shoulder crest, resembling an eldritch bishop. Spines of green light trace its limbs like veins."
