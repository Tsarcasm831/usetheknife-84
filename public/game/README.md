# Game Map Viewer

This folder hosts the standalone map viewer used for the game prototype.

## Google Maps API key

`index.html` loads the Google Maps script using the `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` environment variable. Set this variable in your environment or `.env` file so the API key is substituted when the page loads.
