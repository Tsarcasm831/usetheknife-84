        "emotion": "Okay, let's break down the emotion in this dialogue.  It's leaning towards a mix of **irritation, annoyance, and perhaps a touch of frustration**.\n\nHere\u2019s a more detailed breakdown:\n\n*   **\u201cYeah. Mutants are a nuisance, predictable. Don\u2019t waste my time.\u201d** - This is a direct expression of annoyance and frustration. The repetition of \"Don\u2019t waste my time\" reinforces this.\n\n*   **\"irritation\"** - The overall tone suggests a feeling of irritation.\n\n*   **\u201cFrustration\u201d** - It\u2019s possible there\u2019s a subtle element of frustration because the player is clearly not enjoying the situation.\n\n**Overall, the dominant emotion is annoyance, with a hint of frustration.**\n\nWould you like me to explore this further, perhaps by adding more context or analyzing the possible underlying emotion based on Kaanan\u2019s tone?",
